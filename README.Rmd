## Coach / Manager Climbing on Mound Analysis

I want to know how each coach and manager influences their pitcher when they climbed the mound.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r trimmed_climbing}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
